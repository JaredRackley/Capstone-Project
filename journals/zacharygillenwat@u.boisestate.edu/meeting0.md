# Meeting 0

* Attendance: 100%

In this meeting we brainstormed and discussed several possible project ideas. To begin, we took the list of ideas from the last class's meeting and talked about each of them in order. Many of these ideas piqued our collective interest, and a short list was made of those which we might consider.

Some of my personal favorite ideas were a streaming website like Twitch that only streams audio, and an idle/clicker game in the vein of Cookie Clicker. Having discussed all of the potential ideas that interested us, we decided to post our top 2 choices in the Discord chat at the same time and decide what to choose based on that vote.

We all entered our choices. My hand quaked with anticipation and fear as a hesitant pinky finger hovered over the enter key on my keyboard. This was it - the moment of truth. Someone began a countdown - "3... 2..... 1!" We sent our answers, it was judgement time. To my surprise, Cayson and I had the same two picks. Knowing I had an ally in this fight, I let out a sigh of relief, and my heartbeat slowed to a normal pace again. Jared, however, did not agree with either of our choices.

So anyway, we talked as a group and decided that the idea we were all most okay with was the Twitch streaming thing, so that's what we've decided on for now.

Also I read Jared's journal for this week, he must not realize I get notifications about commits. Because his little "only op codes can be pushed to the repo" idea? Basically stealing my idea. Using a cleverly-crafted loophole I baked into our team contract, I've made it so that every commit must include equivalent code in 6502 assembly so that we can maintain compatibility with the Commodore 64. Take THAT, Rackley!

My tasks:

- Come up with more ideas in case we want to switch I guess
- Look into audio streaming and whatnot
- Figure out how to write 6502 assembly

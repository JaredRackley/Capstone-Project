# Meeting 6

Attendance: 100%

In this meeting we finished the planning lab which we had started on Tuesday. We were a bit confused by the assignment directions but soldiered on anyway. Because of the way our project is set up, having both a backend and frontend, our user stories often have work to be done in the two different components. Since that's the case, we decided the user stories picked out for the planning lab wouldn't necessarily be set in stone. For example, my user story is all relating to audio streaming, but a lot of the work could be done concurrently, or would simply be easier if multiple people worked on the tasks. So it seems like we'll be mixing and matching tasks from different user stories.

After this we determined what system we would use for user logins and other functionality. We were initially unsure what we'd use, needing to decide between Firebase, a SQL database of some kind, and perhaps AWS DynamoDB. Jared has experience using Firebase both in his work and for his 471 project, so he showed us some of the things we could do with it. After discussing some potential drawbacks and alleviating those concerns, we decided that Firebase would be a good choice for our needs as it got rid of a lot of the code work involved with creating a user login system (which isn't the point of this project). I have some concerns that things will come up that Firebase won't be able to handle, however if they do it should be simple enough to set up a new SQL database to handle the need.

Finally we agreed to meet tomorrow for 20 or 30 minutes and discuss site layout, so that we can all be on the same page once we get started on the actual code work of the project.

# Meeting 7

- Attendance: All present

This week, we started feature development on our project. We met over the last weekend to sketch out some of our design features on our front-end.
We also assigned tasks to each group member. Zach is going to focus on getting a simple server going in Go. He has already done some work on it, but
the build is failing, so he is trying to figure that out. My tasks for this week are to setup firebase, and to create some of the features that our 
application uses in every page, such as the menu. I have already set up the initial configuration for firebase, so all thats left for me is to work on 
the sitewide features. Cayson will be working on creating a login and signup page.

My task for this week:

- Make sure Firebase is setup correctly
- Design and start coding some of the components that appear on every page of the site.

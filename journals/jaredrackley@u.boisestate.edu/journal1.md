# Meeting 0

- Attendance: All present

Today our group was intrigued to get started talking about the potential list of topics we could pursue for our capstone project. After everyone stated their greetings, we all banded together to start brainstorming project ideas.

We first talked about ideas from the last meeting, which we were able to come up with given the length of the meeting. In this meeting, we also discussed the ideas that were put into the chat. We voted for three of our favorite ideas for the project.

My teammates were both enraptured by the idea of creating an online podcast service. I liked the idea as well, but Id also like to pursue creating a clone of a popular service such as Discord or Vs Code. It sounds like my idea might come to fruition via a side project, rather than as our capstone.

However, my teammates have yet to learn that Im working on an evil scheme where only code written in binary op codes can be pushed to our Github, which will make this project the most challenging we will ever do. My estimated time to completion is January 29th around 6:37:34pm, but depending on the windspeed, and the position of the astral plane, this completion date could be within 13 hours of my estimation, according to my calculations.

My task for this week:

- Research more ideas for capstone project
- More research into our favorited ideas

# Meeting 8

- Attendance: All present

This week, we continued development on the capstone project. I am still setting up basic ui elements that we will be using on every page of our app, as well as building the skeleton. In this last week, i have made a top ui bar that has all the routes to the pages, and am modifying it based on our needs. Cayson is still working on the register/login pages. Zach is also still working on some of the backend work. He is mostly doing research on the streaming apis we will be using for the backend. He set up a promising solution today, that most likely we will be looking in more depth later on.

My task for this week:

- Continue development on ui elements that affect every page of the website
- Make sure the design of the website meets our needs 
- look at dynamic theming

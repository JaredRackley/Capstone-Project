# Meeting 6

- Attendance: All present

This week, we looked into the different github apps we could add to our application to setup continuous integration.
We set up the build for the Go code, which was pretty easy to do, so our Go code builds everytime we push.
We had a little bit of trouble with pushing the docker containers, because of the authentication parts. However,
Shane said that we need to fork the repo and then add the auth keys. we have not talked about what our final solution is gonna be yet.

My task for this week:

- Checkout more github apps for project.

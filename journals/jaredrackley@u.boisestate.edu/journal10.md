# Meeting 9

- Attendance: Everyone was in attendence.

This week, my group continued work on our capstone project. Cayson is still working on the login/register pages. Zach and I focused somewhat on the nginx server. We discussed our goals going forward. We need to have something that can convert rtmp to hls. Zach is still working on the backend also though. I have temporarily put off my duty to making the front end look good in order to create an nginx server that will work for rtmp. We decided to use a dockerfile for this, so we can easily create the server and so that its standard. One thing we havent ever done is input data into the dockerfile from the main api. We dont know how this will work, but our goal right now is to convert rtmp to hls, and we are not too worried about the logistics right now.

My task for this week:

(same as last week)

- create an nginx server capable of running ffmpeg in an interactive terminal.

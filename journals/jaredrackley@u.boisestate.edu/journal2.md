# Meeting 1

- Attendance: All present

Everyone was a little bit groggy today it seemed like, because it felt a little bit quieter than usual. I stayed up late the night before, so i was not as talkative as usual due to my tiredness.

Today we worked on narrowing down our project idea, and working on figuring out what the implementation was going to look like. We spent a lot of time working on our epic. We spent much of our time in this meeting figuring out what we wanted to include in our project. The idea we came up with was to make an website like twitch, but with only audio streaming. We looked into a couple of names, but have not picked anything yet.

We decided we wanted to a simple UI. We looked at twitch and all agreed that it has a more complex-looking UI than we want. I mentioned that I want a UI that stems off of the simplestic minimalist design of google. I personally do not like to see crowded websites, and would not like our website to be crowded.

We also talked about which features were necessary, and which were stretch features. We decided that we should include every feature that we can think of on the epic, and then update the epic if we have to start cutting out features.

My task for this week:

- Think more about what we do and do not want in our application
- Look into APIs for audio streaming
- Draw or Wireframe project idea

# Meeting 9

- Attendance: Zach slept through the meeting

This week, we continued development on the capstone project. I put in a stream-preview component that renders a user image as well as user data, and made it dynamic. This will help us when we transfer json data from the backend. I also fixed a lot of styling with the sidebar menu. Other than that, Cayson and I forgot about the github page, but Zach was not there anyway so we could not do much. We talked afterward and we agreed to meet sometime this weekend to go over the github page requirements. I also helped Cayson with the user login and register. He was getting a fail error in the console, so we looked over it. I gave him a helpful tutorial to go over.

My task for this week:

(same as last week)

- Continue development on ui elements that affect every page of the website
- Make sure the design of the website meets our needs
- look at dynamic theming

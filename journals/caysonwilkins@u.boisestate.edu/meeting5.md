# Meeting 5

- Attendance: All present

Durring this meeting we set up our continuous integration for our program. We started by setting up a simple tests for our GO project called Oshun. With this it tests basic funtionality and
ability to build the project is all. We then also added a testing build for our front end angular project. In this continuous integration action it builds our docker file which tests out
our front end and also looks to publish the docker to be able to visualize the recent changes. It also only goes off when there is a new release so that way it doesn't go off simply when
we add a journal to the repository.

My Tasks:
- Think about what tasks we can potential add to our project to start working on soon

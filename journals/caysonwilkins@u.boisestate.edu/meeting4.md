# Meeting 4

- Attendance: All present

Durring this meeting our group had to make some fixes to our docker file to make sure that it worked correctly for all of us. We then setup the docker file to work well with our testing.
Our docker file when created runs tests for the front end on it's own, or atleast the basic tests. We then discussed how we were goint to do the tests for our GO programs and figured
that for the format of how docker programs are setup, then we could add the testing file in the actual go project file that we called oshun. Overall we got testing to work in combination
of our docker file building the project and all is well.

My Tasks:
- Test our our current testing process and look into how we will do our continuous integration.

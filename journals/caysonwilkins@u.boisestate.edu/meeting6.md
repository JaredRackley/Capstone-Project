# Meeting 6

- Attendance: All present

Durring this meeting we created our taks and user stories that we will be working on and completing the planning lab. We started by each of us creating our own user story for what
was needing to be done. I focused my user story on user to user interaction which includes the chat for a stream, and the subscription option mainly. After creating our user stories
we created about 5 tasks for each one. We then wrote out our own fiels in the planning folder, with our bsu emails as the name of the document, with what tasks and user story we were
going to plan on working on for the moment. We recognized that we might want to distribute the work differently than just taking on a full story because some are more difficult
than the others, but this was our decision for the time being. We each then created our own definition of done for each task that we are setting for ourselves to complete.

My Tasks:
- Think over what tasks we are going to begin working on the next week and possibly think of other tasks that we may need to squeeze in that we did not think about before.

# Meeting 2

- Attendance: All present

Durring this meeting we discussed what languages we would use for our project as well as what frameworks we should be using. We first talked about what frameworks we could possibly choose
for our type of project and we quickly agreed that using angular for our web app would be nice to use since we all have a little bit of experience in using the framework.
When we were talking about what languages we should use, we would obviously use typescript for front end since we are using angular, and we talked about possibly using C#, NodeJS, or Go.
We started to talk about how maybe we will use multiple but then talked with shane and he mentioned it might be better to stick to one and maybe add later if we want as an outside project.
So for the moment we are thinking of using 1 of them but not positive on which exactly yet.

My Tasks:
- Look into C#, NodeJS, and Go to see which we would want to use

# Meeting 0

- Attendance: All present

For this meeting, we all attended at the correct time scheduled in our discord server that we created for this specific class/project. We had the main goal of coming up with ideas
that we could do for this project. We came up with about 7 good ideas that we thought we could do. Some of them included the idea to remake an application like discord or VSCode
which Jared recommended. We thought the idea of trying to create an apliation to predict Tesla stock changes could be an interesting idea as well. Zach then had the idea of us maybe 
making a web game which I then chimed in and suggested we could maybe make a "clicker" game similar to the semi popular 
web game called cookie clicker. Another big idea we had was to make some kind of streaming website where the idea of making a web app similar to twitch but focused on audio streaming
and maybe focusing certain types of streams like live podcasts.

We then decided to pick 2 each of what ideas out of the few that we had discussed and saw if there were any overlaps to see what ideas we were liking the most to do. Zach and I ended
up picking the same 2 ideas of the streaming service or clicker game. Jared liked the idea of doing an application like discord or creating the Tesla stock predicter possibly
through scanning Elon Musk's tweets. Overall so far we as a gropu decided that the
audio streaming web app would be the most interesting and best choice of the bunch so at the moment that is the idea we are leaning toward doing.

Also, I read Jared and Zach's journal... If they think they can get away with these foul intentions, they are sorely mistaken. I shall do what is in my power to cure this blessed
land of out github from these vile and corrupt ideas.

My Tasks:
- Continue to think of other ideas
- look into how we would do audio streaming

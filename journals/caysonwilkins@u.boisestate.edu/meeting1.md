# Meeting 1

- Attendance: All present

Durring this meeting everyone was present and we discussed what to finalize our project to be. We quickly discussed and decided on doing the audio streaming web app that we were leaning
towards doing last meeting. We then started to look into what features we would want and wrote them in the readme as the project brainstorm assignment. We had many ideas with what 
the layout of the website would be, but to simplify it all down the main features that we are focusing on is the main feature to stream audio to an audience through the web app as well
as talking about possibly adding a chat feature if there was enough time availiable. After discussing the potential features and finishing the assignment, we ended the meeting with having each
of us to start thinking of what frameworks we might need or other api's we might want to use. Also talked about starting to think of what language we might want to use since that was the next
topic to cover for the next time we meet.

My Tasks:
- Start thinking of how we can do our project and what is needed
- Think of potential frameworks

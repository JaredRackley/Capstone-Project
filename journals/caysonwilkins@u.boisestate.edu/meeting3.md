# Meeting 3

- Attendance: All present

Durring this meeting we made sure what language for sure we were going to be working with in the back end. Then with this our main purpose of this meeting was to figure out our
build system and how we were going to accomplish this. With our framework being angular it was pretty simple to build this. We could have chosen to use yarn or npm and we chose to
use yarn as our builder. Then to combine building our backend with the front end, we also decided to make it simpler to run and use by making a docker file to do both the building
and running. This made it easier for us to test our product later on.

My Tasks:
- Test out our docker file and make sure everything works

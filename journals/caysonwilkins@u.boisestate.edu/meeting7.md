# Meeting 7

- Attendance: All present

In this meeting, we looked over the tasks that we had created and decided on what tasks are prioritized to complete first or can be completed first. We figured that we would need
a basic UI in order to set up any additional features wuch as a task bar at the top and ability to login and signup to the website. We distributed the tasks to where I was to work
on the login and sign up page with Zach looking into the streaming options and Jared creating the top task bar and looking into creating the sitebar that will be visible through
out the whole project at all times. We now have the goal to complete these tasks and report back on our progress the next time we meet.

My Tasks:
- Work on my login and signup task
- think of potentially any more tasks that we may need to or want to implement.

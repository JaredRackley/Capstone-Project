Below is the user story focused on the social features of a user. This includes things like
a constant chat interaction on streamer's streams and the ability to subscribe to streamers
and be able to easily access their streams from other locations on the website. Also includes
method of time estimation and definitoin of done for each task.

## User Story

As a user of the website with an account, I should be able to subscribe to and communicate 
with my favorite streamers and have their channels easily accessed to me in the future.

## Tasks

1. Ability to subscribe/unsubscribe from streamers page #10
2. Have subscriptions appear on left hand side bar for easy access #12
3. Implement live chat on streamers page visually #13
4. Store/modify/get user subscriptions #14
5. Research how to get live chat functional #15

### Time estimation method

The team used the method of planning through the person who's task it is extimates their own
tasks. We found that it would be better this way because lots of our tasks would be too difficult
to actually estimate accurately since there is a lot of research involved.

## Definition of Done

- Task 1 DOD - I will know that I am done by having all unit/system tests pass and see a subscribe button,
  that is reactive relitive to if you are currently subscribed or not, on a streamer's account/stream that
  when clicked allows the database to keep track of what user's are subscribed to which other streamer's accounts
- Task 2 DOD - I will know that I am done by having all unit/system tests pass and being able to see
  my subscriptions on the left hand side bar with the ability to click on the streamer's names to 
  access their stream.
- Task 3 DOD - I will know that I am done by having all unit/system tests pass and be able to visually
  see a section on the right hand side of the stream for chat to display correctly and have a text box for
  the user to input their own chat to share.
- Task 4 DOD - I will know that I am done by having all unit/system tests pass and have the database keep track
  of all of the user's subscriptions and have the ability to easily add or modify existing data to keep an up to date
  list of subscriptions.
- Task 5 DOD - I will know that I am done by having the knowledge to have a functional real-time chat work to display
  live chat for a stream.

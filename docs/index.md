### Abstract

Our project is a website similar to Twitch, but that only streams audio instead of video. This is a platform for things like live podcasts, and offers a different experience from existing technologies like internet radio.

The most important aspect of the project will be the ability for users to tune in to audio streams through the UI on the website, and for streamers to be able to record and transmit audio to their streams. Users can stream their audio through their computer to the website. For the user interface, we want a clean and simple look, that is easy to navigate and understand.

Each stream has an associated topic (Music, Podcast, Screaming, etc.). Users can filter on stream category to find the specific kinds of content they are looking for. Streamers can upload a thumbnail to set their stream apart from others or preview the type of content they are streaming. The application will also have some social features, such as a subscription system that will allow users to subscribe to their favorite streams.
